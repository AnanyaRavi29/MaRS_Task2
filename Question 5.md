# NAVIGATION & COMMUNICATIONS:
A number of cameras having different optics for some specific task are installed in a rover for navigation.
The rover also has low-gain and high-gain antennas too for communication purposes..
Acceleromotors and Gyroscopes are also installed. 


# POWER SYSTEM:
The sensors used are:
1.Vibration Sensor
2.Solar Radiation sensor
3.Digital Limit Switch
4.Digital Accelerometer


# ARM:
Servo motors are used as they have fast response, high accuracy and they provide feedback automatically.
At the end of the arm,we have a control sensor that signals the rover arm to stop if it inadvertently touches the ground.
A Visual sensor on top of manipulator which gives a visual feedback.
Trouque Sensor to know how much force is being applied on the object while lifting.
A Rotatory Actuator is used to control the motion of the gripper attached to the arm.


# MOBILITY:
The sensors used are:
1.Distance sensors to measure the distance.
2.Sensors for measuring speed (Wheel pulse encoder)
